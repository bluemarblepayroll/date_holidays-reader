This project is now set up for use with Sorbet. The sorbet/ folder should exist
and look something like this:

    sorbet/
    ├──  config                      # Default options to be passed to sorbet on every run
    └──  rbi/
        ├──  sorbet-typed/           # Community written type definition files for your gems
        ├──  gems/                   # Autogenerated type definitions for your gems (from reflection)
        ├──  hidden-definitions/     # All definitions that exist at runtime, but Sorbet couldn't see statically
        └──  todo.rbi                # Constants which were still missing, even after the three steps above.

Please check this whole folder into version control.

Up to you! First things first, you'll probably want to typecheck your project:

    srb tc

Other than that, it's up to you!
We recommend skimming these docs to get a feel for how to use Sorbet:

- Gradual Type Checking (https://sorbet.org/docs/gradual)
- Enabling Static Checks (https://sorbet.org/docs/static)
- RBI Files (https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi)

If instead you want to explore your files locally, here are some things to try:

- Upgrade a file marked # typed: false to # typed: true.
  Then, run srb tc and try to fix any errors.
- Add signatures to your methods with `sig`.
  For how, read: https://sorbet.org/docs/sigs
- Check whether things that show up in the TODO RBI file actually exist in your project.
  It's possible some of these constants are typos.
- Upgrade a file marked # typed: ignore to # typed: false.
  Then, run srb rbi hidden-definitions && srb tc and try to fix any errors.

🙌 Please don't hesitate to give us your feedback!
